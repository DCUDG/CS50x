# CS50x

Welcome to my GitHub repository for CS50x, Harvard University's introduction of computer science and the art of programming.

## About CS50x

CS50x is an entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, offered by Harvard University to empower students with skills in the most powerful tools in computer science. The course covers a broad range of foundational topics such as algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains all my projects, problem sets, and notes that I have been working on since last year as part of my learning journey through CS50x. Each folder corresponds to a specific problem set or project.

## How to Navigate This Repository

Each folder in the repository is named according to the problem set it corresponds to. Inside, you will find all the necessary files, including source code, resources, and documentation related to each project.
